	<h3 class="heading">Findings</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			There appears to be a strong correlation within the population of persons with less than a high school education not being able to afford healthcare.
		</li>

		<li>
			There appears to be a strong correlation between a lower state unemployment level and percent of population with at least a graduate degree.
		</li>

		<li>
			Further study would be required, but there appears to be a moderate correlation between persons with no healthcare coverage and depression levels.
		</li>
	</ul>
